# Agentic RAG with Database Routing

## Intelligent Query Routing System for Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence

A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that intelligently routes queries to different data sources, performs relevance grading, and implements self-correction mechanisms for comprehensive threat intelligence analysis.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Query Routing
- Dynamic classification of user queries to determine optimal data source
- Multi-database routing based on query intent and data type
- Context-aware decision making for structured vs. unstructured data

### Multi-Source Data Integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Structured threat data (CVEs, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, threat actors)
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic search across threat reports and documentation
- **Redis**: High-performance caching for frequently accessed intelligence

### Self-Correction Mechanisms
- Automatic quality assessment of retrieved results
- Dynamic strategy adaptation when initial results are insufficient
- Multi-step reasoning chains for complex threat analysis

### Advanced AI Capabilities
- LangGraph-powered agent workflows for autonomous decision making
- Confidence scoring and relevance grading
- Contradiction resolution across conflicting data sources
- Progressive information synthesis from multiple databases

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (async, high-performance)
- **Databases**: 
  - PostgreSQL (structured data)
  - Qdrant (vector embeddings)
  - Redis (caching layer)
- **AI/ML Frameworks**:
  - LangChain (orchestration)
  - LangGraph (agent workflows)
  - OpenAI/Local LLMs (language models)
- **Language**: Python 3.11+

## Dataset Overview

### Structured Data (PostgreSQL)
- 10,000+ recent CVE records (2023-2024)
- Complete MITRE ATT&CK framework (1,000+ techniques)
- 500+ threat actor profiles
- 5,000+ malware hash samples

### Unstructured Data (Qdrant)
- 500+ threat intelligence reports
- Security advisories and bulletins
- Incident response playbooks
- Best practices documentation

### Performance Metrics
- Sub-second query response time
- 95%+ relevance accuracy
- Automatic failover and retry mechanisms

## Use Cases

### Threat Intelligence Analysis
```
Query: "Show me ransomware campaigns targeting healthcare in 2024"
Response: Combines CVE data, threat reports, and actor attribution
```

### Vulnerability Prioritization
```
Query: "What critical vulnerabilities affect our Apache servers?"
Response: Cross-references CVEs with exploitation data and patches
```

### Attack Pattern Recognition
```
Query: "Find similar attack techniques to CVE-2024-1234"
Response: MITRE technique mapping with real-world usage examples
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
